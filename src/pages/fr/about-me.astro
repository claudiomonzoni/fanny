            <h2>A Journey Shaped by Many Paths</h2>
            <p>
              My journey has taken me across the globe and through many roles:
              Dance Movement Psychotherapist, Osteopath, Womenâ€™s Temple
              Facilitator, Palliative Carer, Yogini, and Mother of a child with
              special needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of these experiences has shaped the way I meet others.. with
              presence, compassion, and reverence for the resilience and beauty
              of being human.

            <h2>A Journey Through Movement and Meaning</h2>
            <p>
              I love exploring movement, dance, music, feelings, and the
              challenges that arise within myself and others, as pathways into a
              more embodied experience of the present moment.
            </p>

            <p>
              The body, spirit, and emotions have always fascinated me. How they
              weave together with music, healing, life, and even death to reveal
              our deepest truths.
